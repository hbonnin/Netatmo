Netatmo

Netatmo uses the Netatmo php sdk and some Google development tools for the graphics.
The server needs to have a php version greater than 5, with curl and json enabled.
This program can display the data of at most four stations.

Install :

    Unzip the archive
    Put your personal information in Config.php
    open index.php in your web browser
    
Note :
	
	If you do not have access to a server, you can create an HTML file in a window command.
	For example to display the graphs for the last month of minimal and maximale temperatures of the first station:
	php minmaxStation.php a >minmax.html    
	The parameter 'a' is there so that minmaxStation.php knows that it is called from a command line.
