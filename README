Netatmo

Netatmo uses the Netatmo php sdk and some Google development tools for the graphics.
The server needs to have a php version >= 5, with curl, json and session enabled.
If you have a Netmo account, you can  see a demo at  http://fraysseix.webatu.com/Netatmo/
and a readme  with pictures at http://fraysseix.webatu.com/Netatmo/README.html.

          (5 minutes, 30 minutes, 3 hours, 1 day or 1 week interval for a given period),
