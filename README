Netatmo

Netatmo uses the Netatmo php sdk and some Google development tools for the graphics.
The server needs to have a php version >= 5, with curl and json enabled.

Main windows :
	
	- Display on a Google map all the stations with their last measures
	- Graphics of the temperatures of up to 4 stations, 
	  from a given date
	- Graphics of all measures of one station, 
	  from a given date
	- Graphics of extremal temperatures of one station,
	  from a given date   

Install :

    Unzip the archive
    Put your personal information in Config.php
    open index.php in your web browser
    
Note :
	
	If you do not have access to a server, you can create an HTML file
	from a command line.
	For example to display the graphs for the last month of minimal and
	maximal temperatures of the first station:
	php minmaxStation.php a >minmax.html    
	The parameter 'a' is there so that minmaxStation.php knows that it is 
	called from a command line.
